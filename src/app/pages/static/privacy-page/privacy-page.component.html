                        WorkiFence.com (“Work iFence,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) values its users’ privacy across the WorkiFence.com website (WorkiFence.com), mobile site, and apps (collectively, the “Properties”). This Privacy Policy pertains to our Properties, the services that we offer on our Properties and your interactions with us outside our Properties other than through our browser extensions (collectively, the “Services”). We have implemented this Privacy Policy to provide you with information about how Work iFence collects, uses, and discloses information about you. By visiting our Properties or using our Services in any other way, you are agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Privacy Policy does not apply to our browser extensions, which have different practices. To learn about the information practices for our browser extensions, you should view the Extension Privacy Policy rather than this Privacy Policy. If you choose to use a workifence.com browser extension in addition to other Services, then the information collected through the extension may be combined with information we collect through other Services, and we will use this combined information to provide both the extension and our other Services to you.

                    <h4 class="title">What Types of Personal Information Does Work iFence Collect from Me?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Work iFence will collect the personal information you provide to us, for example when you register, take a survey, sign up for notifications, participate in a sweepstakes, email us or otherwise send us your contact information. Personal information may include your name, email address, phone number, mailing and/or billing address, and other information that identifies you as an individual. You can use some of the Services without providing these types of personal information, but certain features may not be available. If you would like to update these types of personal information that you previously provided to us, you can log into your account or email us at <b>admin&#64;workifence.com</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you access our Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device. We also collect information about your device’s precise location over time to provide you with more relevant deals, such as offering deals in real time for a store that you are visiting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each time you use our Services, Work iFence also automatically collects other technical information, which may be combined with other information we collect about you. This technical information includes, for example, your browser type, the URL of the previous website you visited, your Internet Service Provider, your operating system, and your IP address. We may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect such information as described below. We also use analytics and reporting technologies to collect records of your browsing and activities when using our Services, as well as other usage information such as your clickstream patterns, your preferences, and the dates and times that you use our Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you receive email or texts from us, we will analyze related information such as whether you open the email or read the text, and whether you click on an ad or offer in the email or text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To help us personalize the Services, we may offer you the ability to opt in to allow Work iFence to automatically scan the emails received and sent in certain email accounts (e.g., Gmail). If you do, Work iFence will scan your emails in order to collect and analyze information about your purchases over time, the marketing emails that you receive and how you respond to them, and your participation in loyalty programs. We will use all of this information in order to provide you with more relevant content and recommendations through our Services. For any information scanned from a Gmail account, Work iFence complies with Google’s policies and restrictions on how we can use or share this information. Work iFence can scan your emails only if you choose to enable this service by providing us with your email access credentials. You can use our Services without participating in email scanning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you provide us with your address, we may use third-party services such as the Google Places API to help complete your address information after you begin to type it. We will combine the address information that we collect through this service with any other information that we collect from or about you, and we will use, retain, and share it as described in this Privacy Policy. Additionally, this address completion service allows Google to collect certain information as described below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may collect information about you from third parties in other ways as well. If you log in via a third-party service like Facebook or Google, we will collect the information described in the third-party service’s request for authorization. This information may include your name, email address, gender, city, and state. You should review your privacy settings with these third-party services to be sure you are only sharing information you wish to share. Additionally, when you click on a link from our Services, we may receive information from merchants (and their affiliates) about your activities on their linked platforms, such as your purchases. We may use this information to support loyalty programs with merchants or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. We may also obtain information, including personal information, about you from other third parties and combine it with the information that we collect from you.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="title">What About Cookies and Web Beacons?</h4>
        
                    <p>
                        In addition, Work iFence (and our third-party service providers) use “cookies,” a small data string our server writes to your computer, and other similar technologies to help us manage and analyze your interaction with our Services. These technologies can store information that we collect about you, and can collect information linked to your browser or device that we use for a number of purposes, including improving our Services, keeping count of return visits to our Properties or our advertisers’ or partners’ websites, collecting and reporting statistical information about our users, saving your password and login information, displaying advertising or content based on your interests (as further described below), and learning about how you interact with email or text messages and advertising content. We may also collect information about your search criteria and results, the date and time of your visit to our Properties, and your connection speed and IP address. Cookies may store information that identifies your device, like a hashed email address, but we do not use cookies to store individual identifiers like your name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via our Services may also use cookies on our Properties, and we encourage you to check their privacy policies for information about their information privacy practices.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        You may be able to refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, refusing to receive cookies will not stop all data collection and may prevent you from being able to use the full functionality of our Services.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        Additionally, emails we send may contain a bit of code known as a “web beacon.” This code allows us to understand the time and date when you open an email and when you use a link within the email to visit a website. If you wish to disable our web beacons, you can do so by turning images “off” in your email software (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email software instructions or “Help” for more information.
